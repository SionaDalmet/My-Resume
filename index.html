                            I am currently interning at Josho IT Solutions, a U.S.-India-based company, 
                            where I've had the opportunity to learn a great deal about software development 
                            and the practical application of AI tools. During this internship, 
                            I've worked on building real-time, functional websites, utilizing platforms like Wix and incorporating AI-driven features. 
                            I've also gained familiarity with Power BI, which has given me a solid understanding of data visualization and business analytics. 
                            This experience has been invaluable in helping me enhance my technical skills and broaden my expertise.
